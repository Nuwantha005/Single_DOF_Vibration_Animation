# Single_DOF_Vibration_Animation

Single degree of freedom systems contaion only one type of repetitive motion and therefore equation of motion is a single sencond order differencial equation.

$$ m \ddot{x} + c \dot{x} + kx = 0 $$

Solving this equation often uses assumption that solution is in the form of $x = X_0 e^{st}$ and substituting this will give following quadration equation.

$$ ms^2 + cs + k = 0 $$

# Examples
There are mainly 4 senarios that can be animated
### 1) No Damping
When damping coefficient is equal to zero (c = 0), there is no damping happening and harmonic motion continues forever.

### 2) Under Damped
### 3) Critically Damped
### 4) Overdamped
